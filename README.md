The test task:

Given a plaintext file containing URLs, one per line, e.g.:

http://mywebserver.com/images/271947.jpg
http://mywebserver.com/images/24174.jpg
http://somewebsrv.com/img/992147.jpg

Write a script that takes this plaintext file as an argument and downloads all images,
storing them on the local hard disk. Approach the problem as you would any task in a normal day’s work.
Imagine this code will be used in important live systems, modified later on by other developers, and so on.
